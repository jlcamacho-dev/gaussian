# gaussian
Application to study the precision and accuracy of linear system solutions using Naive Gaussian Elimination and Scaled Partial Pivoting 

# To Run 
1. in terminal run 'python3 filename.lin' 
by default the program runs naive gaussian elimination. To invoke Scaled Partial Pivoting invoke '--spp' i.e. 'python3 --spp sys1.lin' 

# Note 
Applicatoin takes in file with '.lin' extension and will generate a filename with '.sol' extension
